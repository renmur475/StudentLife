# About
We built an app for students that allows them to easily organize their school life. The app features an assignment calendar, note taking and flashcards, and a scientific calculator. As students, we know how easy it is to become disorganized with school. We want to help our fellow students stay organized so they can feel less stressed. Christina worked on the home screen, notes, and flashcards portion of the app, while Renee worked on the assignment calendar and calculator.

# How to Use
## Home Screen 
The user is greeted with the home screen where they can click the buttons for the following apps: "Calculator", "Calender", "Notes", and "Flashcards".

## Calculator
In the Calculator app enter two numbers to be used at a time. 

## Calender
In the Calender app enter an assignment name and choose its due date by pressing the calendar icon next to it. Add the assignment to the table by clicking the "Add" button. When you finish an assignment, click the checkbox to mark it off and the "Hide finished assignments" button to remove done assignments from view. 

## Notes
In the Notes app, the user can type any text into the text area. Then, they can press the "Save" button to save that text to a .txt file on their computer. The user can also open a .txt file using the "Open" button, and the text will display in the text area. Clicking the "Home" button will return to the home screen. 

## Flashcards
In the Flashcards app, the user can enter the front and back of a virtual flashcard. Under the text, "Side 1" the user can enter text for the first side of the card in the text area. Under "Side 2", the user can enter text for the other side. Once the text has been added to both sides, the user can click the "Add" button to add the flashcard. The user can write up to 99 flashcards. Once the user has entered their flashcards, they can click the "Study" button. This opens a new window where a front side of a random flashcard is displayed. If the user clicks the "Flip" button, the flashcard displays the opposite side. If the user clicks the "Next" button, another random flashcard will be displayed. To exit, the user can close the "Study" window. Clicking the "Home" button will return to the home screen.
